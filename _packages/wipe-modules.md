# wipe-modules

> A little agent that removes the node_modules folder of non-active projects


## Why

If you're a Javascript developer, you know the `node_modules` directory holds thousands or even millions of files, resulting in taking a lot of space in your hard disk.

Enter `wipe-modules`, a little agent that wipes (eats, literally) that big `node_modules` directory of non-active projects.

Why in Earth would you want to have those monster-sized `node_modules` folders on inactive projects? You got your `package.json` to recreate it whenever you want, right?


## Usage

```
$ wipe-modules --help

  Usage: wipe-modules [path] [days]

  Path:
    The full path of your code directory

  Days:
    The days you want to set to mark projects as inactive

  Example: wipe-modules ~/code 30

  That will remove the node_modules of your ~/code projects
  whose been inactive for 30 days or more.
```


## Using cron

`wipe-modules` can be executed as a background job using using [cron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron)

The default included `cron-file` file holds the following syntax:

`0 11 * * * $HOME/bin/wipe-modules ~/code_dir 30`

That is the crontab (cron table) file, it instructs cron to run the `wipe-modules ~/code_dir 30` script everyday at 11:00 am.

Edit the `cron-file` to match your own needs, see [how to set up a crontab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron#Overview) for more info.

Now set the `cron-file` crontab file in cron using:

``
$ crontab ~/path_to_cronfile/cron-file
``

And you're done!

To check if you've successfully added your crontab type:

``
$ crontab -l
``

It should display your crontab.

To edit a crontab, use `crontab -e` and to delete all crontabs use `crontab -r`.

Note that `crontab -r` will destroy all your crontabs, that's why it's a good idea to keep your crontab commands in a `cron-file`.

Cron is only supported in unix operating systems.
